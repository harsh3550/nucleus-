1. What are the three different ways of creating Singleton Objects? Show a demo of all three.








2. Find out which of the SOLID principles are used in Java API and which part of API. Explain the 
same citing the references in a pdf file.






3. Re-create the addLoanProduct() method of Bank Class created in Question-2 of Day-6 
assignment with the help of Builder Pattern.





4. Implement Factory Design pattern to create the object of Bank Class using the interfaces –
Maker and Operator as mentioned in the Question – 3 of Day-6 assignment. The object of 
the bank must be accessed using the command mentioned below

Maker maker = Bank.Factory.getMakerInstance();
 or 
 Operator operator = Bank.Factory.getOperatorInsatance();
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Change the method – printAllCustomers() of the same class as above Question. While we are 
printing the array of Customers, we need to sort the same based on the requirement of the 
User. If user wants the Customers to be printed sorted based on Customer Name, it must 
print the result in the same manner. If user wants Customers to be printed sorted based on 
totalMonthlyExpense, it must be able to do the same. Use Strategy Pattern to implement 
the same as mentioned below:




6.Assume we already have a NumberSorter available which sorts a list of Integers as displayed 
below



The requirement is to sort an array of integers. Use Adapter pattern to sort the integer array 
which inturn will use the NumberSorter class provided to us as mentioned below:



7. Findout which part of Java API is based on Adapter pattern. Document your findings
